This project detects the pupil in eye images and calculates its diameter in millimeters.
It includes grayscale, Gaussian blur, types/dilation, thresholding, edge detection and ellipse fitting operations.
To use the algorithm, you need to set your eye size as a reference and set the pixel transformations for your own computer.
